### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Growing up in the concrete jungle of South Korea, I never had a lot of opportunities to interact with nature yet I was still drawn to what I now know as the field of ecology and evolutionary biology. I was extremely fortunate to have middle-class parents who supported my interests and dreams, and ultimately led me to the path I stand today.

However, I am aware that not everyone is as privileged, especially with all the systematic barriers in place. I have learned a lot about North American history and culture during my time in the U.S. and while I am no longer shocked by the atrocities, I know we have a long road ahead. As a PhD student, I work hard to make my community, my field station, and my classrooms equitable, inclusive, and safe to everyone. This is a constant work in progress and I know I will make mistakes along the way, but I am committed to my lifelong goal.

Through the Archbold Expeditions Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, I have been working with my colleagues to establish a field safety protocol for the station, inspired by great work from [Demery and Pipkin 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01328-5?proof=t){:target="\_blank" rel=“noopener”}, in order to inform and protect all interns, visiting scholars, and researchers. I will start serving on the Association of Field Ornithologist’s Ethics Committee to develop a complete code of ethics
for all ornithologists in our society. I also work on various community efforts, including moderating the Diversity and Inclusion Workshop for the North American Ornithological Congress and volunteering for Cornell Diversity Preview Weekend.

### Teaching Philosophy


### Teaching Experience
#### Teaching as an instructor
  - **Writing in the Majors**, An Introduction to Evolutionary Biology and Diversity (Spring 2021), Cornell University A writing-intensive track of the original course that integrates course material supplemented with additional reading material, discussions, and writing. I design and lead the course as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. My goals for the semester include helping students:
      - understand major evolutionary processes and describe examples that illustrate these principles
      - read, analyze, discuss, and write about primary literature in evolutionary biology through active learning
      - think critically and creatively about the biology and science in published literature
      - communicate about scientific ideas through writing and discussion
      - appreciate questions in and implications of evolutionary biology

#### Teaching assistantships
  - An Introduction to Evolutionary Biology and Diversity (Fall 2020)
  - Mammalogy, Lectures and Laboratory (Fall 2017 and 2019)
  - An Introduction to Ecology and the Environment (Fall 2016)
  - Habitat Conservation and Restoration Laboratory (Winter 2014 and
    2015, UC Davis)
      - helped students design and execute group projects at Yolo Basin
        Wildlife Area
  - Biology and Conservation of Wild Mammals, Laboratory (Spring 2014,
    UC Davis)
  - Natural History of California’s Wild Vertebrates (Winter 2014, UC
    Davis)
