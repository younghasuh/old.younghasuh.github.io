#### Children's book
During my time at the Kalahari Meerkat Project, we learned that many rural South African communities were illegally poaching and keeping wildlife as pets. My colleagues and I decided to write a children's book to promote anti-poaching and wildlife conservation. We all came up with the storyline while Sam Lostrom and I did the illustrations. We managed to get a publisher for the book and published it in February of 2019 with Sub-Saharan Publishers. We wrote the book in Afrikaans and Sestwana, in addition to English, and donated over 500 books to local schools and farms throughout northwester South Africa. This was a collaborative project that I was truly excited to be a part of.
