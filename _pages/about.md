I started a new position as the Ornithology Collections Manager at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. 

I received my Ph.D. from the department of [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at Cornell University and the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, co-advised by Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Mike Webster. I conducted all fieldwork at Archbold Biological Station with Dr. Reed Bowman. My dissertation aims to understand why is there so much variation in life history strategies within a population? I have been studying dispersal decisions in the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jay. I use long-term and field-collected data, as well as newly developed tracking technology to study movement leading up to dispersal.
