### Research Overview

I study variation in dispersal behavior of an intensively monitored population of Florida Scrub-Jays *Aphelocoma coerulescens*, a federally listed habitat specialist that is restricted to the endangered and declining Florida scrub habitat. In this cooperatively breeding species, offspring delay dispersal for at least a year, sometimes up to 5-6, which begs the question, why? I have been working with this fascinating corvid through the Avian Ecology Lab at the Archbold Biological Station in central FL. The population here has been studied for 50 years, and we have extensive demographic and habitat data for every jay that has occurred in the study tract.
