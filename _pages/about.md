I am interested in why variation in life history strategies exist within a population. To start answering this question, I have been studying dispersal decisions in the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jay. I use long-term and field-collected data, as well as newly developed tracking technology to study movement leading up to dispersal.

I am a PhD candidate in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-advised by Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Mike Webster. I conduct all fieldwork at Archbold Biological Station.
