### Overview of Florida scrub-jay Tracking Project 

To collect constant movement data from Florida scrub-jays, we have deployed an automated movement tracking system developed by [Cellular Tracking Technologies](https://celltracktech.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

#### How it works

The CTT automated tracking system utilizes a combination of [sensor stations](https://celltracktech.com/products/tag-system/ctt-sensorstation/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and a grid of [receivers nodes](https://celltracktech.com/products/tag-system/ctt-node/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that pick up signals emitted from [LifeTags](https://celltracktech.com/products/tag-system/lifetag/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and a grid of [receivers nodes](https://celltracktech.com/products/tag-system/ctt-node/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
